## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at in Computer Science at the Ca' Foscari University of Venice (Italy). Prior to this, I earned a Master's Degree in Computer Science from the University of Padua (Italy), with a curricula focused on AI and software development. Additionally, I hold a BSc in Computer Games Technology from the University of the West of Scotland (UK).

My primary academic interests revolve around explainable and trustworthy AI, with a focus on Natural Language Processing. Additionally, I've delved into explainable AI techniques for Computer Vision tasks, and I am currently exploring the possibilities provided by explanation techniques for graph-based methods.

Beyond academics, I'm passionate about videogame design, music, and animals.

## Research Interests

- **Explainable AI:** Explanation techniques, transparent models, XAI frameworks;
- **Natural Language Processing:** Text classification, summarization, interpretable NLP models;
- **Graph Learning:** Graph Neural Networks, explanation techniques for graph-based methods;
- **Fuzzy Logic**: Data-driven Fuzzy Inference Systems, Fuzzy Neural Networks.
